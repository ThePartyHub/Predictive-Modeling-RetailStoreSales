# Predictive-Modeling
Exploratory and explanatory analysis done to transform a retail store's scanner data into meaningful insights.

This study utilized a retail stores' scanner data to analyze sales performance, and predict sales of future weeks. 

Analysis Structure:
1. Exploratory analysis to get more familiar with the data set
2. Checks for missing values and imputations (if required)
3. Correlation checks and developing hyothesis
4. Building marketing mix models iteratively to get hints of patterns in data (if any)
5. Exploring options of principal component analysis and factor analysis to reduce the number of predictor variables and reduce multicollinearity
6. Using random effects for better causal models. Random effects by store, market region and time of year
7. Sampling of data; Test and Training data set
8. Optimization of causal model to reduce the RMSE value of test data set


Data Structure:
- Weekly sales of 124 stores across 104 weeks
- Variables of 5 brands: Unit Sales, UPCs(shelf depth), Discount, Promotional Efforts (Feature, Display and Both)
